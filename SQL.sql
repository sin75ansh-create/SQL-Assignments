-- SOLUTIONS

-- Question 1: Retrieve all customers who have placed at least one order
-- Using INNER JOIN
SELECT DISTINCT c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName, c.City
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o 
ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID;


-- Question 2: Retrieve all customers and their orders, including customers who have not placed any orders
-- Using LEFT JOIN
SELECT c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName, c.City, o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, o.Amount
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o 
ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID;


-- Question 3: Retrieve all orders and their corresponding customers, including orders placed by unknown customers
-- Using RIGHT JOIN or LEFT JOIN
SELECT c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName, c.City, o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, o.Amount
FROM Customers c
RIGHT JOIN Orders o 
ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID;


-- Question 4: Display all customers and orders, whether matched or not
-- Using FULL OUTER JOIN (MySQL doesn't support FULL OUTER JOIN directly, so use UNION)
SELECT c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName, c.City, o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, o.Amount
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o 
ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
UNION
SELECT c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName, c.City, o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, o.Amount
FROM Customers c
RIGHT JOIN Orders o 
ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID;


-- Question 5: Find customers who have not placed any orders
-- Using LEFT JOIN with NULL check
SELECT c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName, c.City
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o 
ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
WHERE o.OrderID IS NULL;


-- Question 6: Retrieve customers who made payments but did not place any orders
SELECT c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName, c.City
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Payments p 
ON c.CustomerID = p.CustomerID
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
WHERE o.OrderID IS NULL;


-- Question 7: Generate a list of all possible combinations between Customers and Orders
-- Using CROSS JOIN
SELECT c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName, c.City, o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, o.Amount
FROM Customers c
CROSS JOIN Orders o;


-- Question 8: Show all customers along with order and payment amounts in one table
SELECT 
    c.CustomerID, 
    c.CustomerName, 
    c.City,
    o.OrderID,
    o.OrderDate,
    o.Amount AS OrderAmount,
    p.PaymentID,
    p.PaymentDate,
    p.Amount AS PaymentAmount
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o 
ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
LEFT JOIN Payments p 
ON c.CustomerID = p.CustomerID;


-- Question 9: Retrieve all customers who have both placed orders and made payments
-- Using INNER JOIN on both tables
SELECT DISTINCT c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName, c.City
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o 
ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
INNER JOIN Payments p 
ON c.CustomerID = p.CustomerID;
